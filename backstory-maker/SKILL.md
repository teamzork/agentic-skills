# Backstory of the Guide (StoryBrand Framework)

## Overview

This skill generates compelling founder and company backstories using the StoryBrand "8 Beats" narrative structure. The framework oscillates between negative and positive story beats to create dramatic tension while positioning the founder as a competent guide (not the hero) and always centering the customer's benefit.

## When to Use

- **Appropriate contexts:** About Us pages, onboarding email sequences (email #3 or #4), investor updates, Founder's Story content, brand videos, sizzle reels
- **Output formats:** Written copy, video scripts with B-roll footage, voiceover narratives
- **DO NOT use for:** Home page hero sections, cold ads, initial sales pitches, or early-stage pitch decks (Slide 1)

This framework assumes trust has already been established and the lead is interested but needs deeper connection.

## Requirements

- Specific history of the product/founder with real examples
- Context that this is for an audience already familiar with your offering
- Trust has been established with the reader

## Workflow

### 1. Context Check

Before proceeding, verify:
- Is this content intended for a cold lead or sales deck opener?
- **If YES:** Stop. Advise the user to use a Problem/Solution framework instead. This skill is exclusively for deepening established relationships.

### 2. Data Extraction (The 8 Beats)

Ask the user for these specific plot points if not provided:

1. **The Hole** — The founder's **exact same struggle** the customer is currently facing. **Critical constraint:** This must be the identical problem the customer has right now, not just a related struggle. If the founder's "hole" isn't the customer's current hole, the story positions the founder as someone "standing over a guy in a hole" talking about their own life while the customer is "dying of thirst."

2. **The Calling** — The moment the founder decided others deserved a solution to this problem

3. **The Refinement** — The "training montage" or "Tom Cruise learning a skill" beat. The hard work/iteration required to build competency and create the beta/MVP. This is the Hero's Challenge where the founder gains the expertise to eventually become the Guide.

4. **The Dark Night** — The "All Is Lost" moment from screenwriting: a major catastrophe where failure seemed certain. Examples:
   - Server crashed the day before launch
   - Government denied trademark
   - Partner ran off with the secret formula
   - Pandemic destroyed 85% of revenue overnight (StoryBrand's actual crisis)

5. **The Miracle** — The *deus ex machina* or unexpected event that saved the business

6. **The Breakthrough** — The core realization or lesson learned from the miracle

7. **The Better World** — What the customer specifically experiences now because of this journey
8. **The Moral** — The philosophical bottom line

### 3. Drafting (The Formula)

Draft the narrative using this strict negative/positive oscillation structure:

#### Beat 1 (Negative): The Hole
- **Template:** "Our story started when we were facing [PROBLEM] and it looked like [HOPELESS SITUATION]."

#### Beat 2 (Positive): The Calling
- **Template:** "We kept going because we saw customers struggling with [PROBLEM] and believed they deserved [RESULT]."

#### Beat 3 (Negative): The Refinement
- **Template:** "We kept improving because customers needed [RESULT] and we refused to give them anything less."

#### Beat 4 (Negative - Peak Tension): The Dark Night
- **Template:** "Just when things seemed to be working, [CATASTROPHE] happened and we almost lost everything."

#### Beat 5 (Positive): The Miracle
- **Template:** "Then something unexpected happened: [EVENT] gave us a second chance."

#### Beat 6 (Positive): The Breakthrough
- **Template:** "When we focused on [INSIGHT], customers finally got [RESULT] and everything changed."

#### Beat 7 (Positive): The Better World
- **Template:** "Today, customers experience [SUCCESS] because they no longer have to deal with [PAIN]."

#### Beat 8 (Summary): The Moral
- **Template:** "The bottom line is: [CORE BELIEF]."

### 4. Review & Polish

- **Entertain:** Ensure the "Dark Night" feels high-stakes. If it feels boring, ask the user to dramatize the emotion.
- **Positioning Check:** Ensure the founder is portrayed as *Yoda* (competent guide), not *Luke Skywalker* (the hero). The story exists only to prove competency to the customer.

## Gotchas

### The "Same Hole" Constraint (Critical)
The founder's "hole" must be the **exact same hole the customer is currently in**. The story only works if the founder positions themselves as an expert in *getting out of the specific problem* the customer currently faces.

- ❌ **Wrong:** Telling a story about learning to code when your customer's problem is marketing
- ✅ **Right:** Telling a story about terrible marketing results when your customer's problem is marketing

If you violate this rule, you're just telling an irrelevant biography while the customer waits for you to solve their actual problem.

### The "Hero" Trap
Users often make the story about their own glory. You must reframe every beat to show how it benefits the *customer*.

- ❌ **Wrong:** "I worked hard to become the best coder."
- ✅ **Right:** "I worked hard to perfect the code so you wouldn't experience downtime."

### Timing & The "Airplane Engine" Anti-Pattern
If this is used too early (e.g., Slide 1 of a pitch deck), it kills the sale. This is "drinks after the meeting" content.

**Real Anti-Pattern Example:** A company that cleans airplane engines opened their pitch deck with company values and their backstory. They struggled to close deals because buyers only cared about cost savings and physics. When they removed the story and led with Problem/Solution (the engine's efficiency), they cut their sales cycle by six months.

**Rule:** If the buyer is evaluating you on logic and ROI, lead with data. Save the story for after trust is established.

### The "Dark Night" Intensity
Users often downplay their failures. The "Dark Night" must feel like an "All Is Lost" moment—a genuine existential threat to the business—to create necessary narrative tension. Examples:
- Government wouldn't allow trademark
- Partner ran off with secret formula  
- Pandemic destroyed 85% of revenue
- Server crashed hours before launch

### Values vs. Story
Do not list "Core Values." Tell the *events* that demonstrated those values.

## Examples

### Example 1: StoryBrand Origin Story (Master Example)

**Context:** Donald Miller's actual story used to explain StoryBrand's origin

**The 8 Beats:**
1. **The Hole:** Miller wrote a book a passenger on a plane loved but couldn't explain *why*. He realized he was great at writing but terrible at selling because his message wasn't clear—the same problem his customers face.
2. **The Calling:** He realized he needed to clarify his message to sell, and saw other businesses struggling with the same clarity issue.
3. **The Refinement:** He tested the framework on small businesses and saw their revenue double. He refined the framework 25 times through iteration.
4. **The Dark Night:** The COVID-19 pandemic hit. 85% of StoryBrand's revenue (live workshops) vanished overnight. The business was on the verge of collapse.
5. **The Miracle:** They pivoted to livestream workshops, and 800 people signed up immediately.
6. **The Breakthrough:** They realized that as long as they helped customers clarify their messages, the delivery medium (live vs. stream) didn't matter.
7. **The Better World:** Today, thousands of businesses have clear messaging and growing revenue because they no longer confuse customers.
8. **The Moral:** Clarity drives revenue.

### Example 2: SaaS for Project Management (Condensed Version)

**Output:**
"Our story started when our agency was drowning in missed deadlines (The Hole). We realized creative teams deserved to do great work without the chaos (The Calling). We spent two years coding a tool just for creatives (The Refinement), but the day before launch, our primary API provider shut down (The Dark Night). We thought it was over. Then, a competitor offered to open their legacy API to us temporarily (The Miracle). We realized that collaboration, not competition, was the key to speed (The Breakthrough). Today, agencies ship projects 3x faster because they no longer fight their tools (The Better World). We believe software should get out of your way (The Moral)."

### Example 3: Video Script Application

**Format:** Voiceover script for B-roll footage

**Script:**
[Show founder at desk, stressed]
"Five years ago, I was losing clients because I couldn't deliver designs on time..."
[Show founder testing early prototype]
"I knew designers everywhere faced this same bottleneck..."
[Montage of design iterations]
"We spent 18 months building a tool that would give hours back to creatives..."
[Show empty office, pandemic reference]
"Then the pandemic hit, and 90% of our beta testers went out of business. We almost gave up..."
[Show virtual meeting, team collaboration]
"But the designers who survived told us: they needed our tool more than ever..."
[Show successful project completion]
"Today, over 10,000 designers ship client work 5x faster because they're no longer buried in version control..."
[Show logo]
"Great design deserves great tools."
