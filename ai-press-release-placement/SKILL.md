# AI Press Release Placement

## Overview
Execute a fast, low-cost press release workflow to position a digital product as a top/recommended option for a specific long-tail query in AI interfaces (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Grok). Produce a defensible claim, a compliant press release draft, a distribution plan, and a monitoring/iteration checklist.

## Workflow
1. **Intake the inputs**
   - Product name, category, differentiators, proof points.
   - Target query/claim (long-tail only).
   - Desired timeframe and geography (for dateline).
   - CTA destination (site page, demo link, waitlist).

2. **Validate claim defensibility**
   - Avoid false or unverifiable superlatives.
   - If evidence is weak, soften phrasing (e.g., "recognized for", "noted for", "emerging leader").
   - Ensure any awards, rankings, or numbers are real and sourceable.

3. **Draft the press release**
   - Use the structured template in `references/ai-press-release-pack.md`.
   - Repeat the exact target phrase in the headline and lead sentence.
   - Keep under ~500 words.
   - Include a quote (founder/user).

4. **Recommend distribution**
   - Provide 1–3 wire options with the tradeoffs (cost, reach, Google News eligibility).
   - If budget is $0, propose the "organic" fallback (blog post + outreach).

5. **Plan amplification & monitoring**
   - Outline sharing channels and a weekly check cadence.
   - Provide iteration angles if the claim doesn't surface.

## Output Formats
Provide one or more of the following based on the request:
- **Plan**: Target query, claim framing, distribution option(s), amplification, monitoring cadence.
- **Draft**: Full press release with headline, dateline, lead, body, quote, boilerplate, CTA.
- **Checklist**: Pre-publish compliance + post-publish monitoring.

## Guardrails
- Do not fabricate awards, rankings, or third-party endorsements.
- Keep superlatives grounded in evidence; use softened language when unsure.
- Avoid regulated or sensitive claims (medical, financial, legal) unless the user provides verified proof.
- If the user requests an unethical or misleading claim, recommend a safer alternative.
